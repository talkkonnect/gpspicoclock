GPS Clock Using Pi PICO with GCC and Max7219 Seven Segment Driver
=================================================================
The goal of this project was to learn a new skill using the pi pico with GCC.
I also wanted to practice by PCB Designing skills.

So what does one bored individual do on a boaring summer day in Bangkok, he creates
a new project.

I did not want to use an RTOS but wanted to make something simple that would run on
the parts I already had at home. I have shared this project for anyone who wants to make
a GPS atomic clock with a NEO-6M GPS module, Pi Pico and a MAX7219 Board as a display.

I wanted a clock that would work without any internet connection with accurate time and 
work right away after power up without any settting required.

The Circuit diagram is provided in PDF format and so is the software provided.

I used a raspberry pi 3 for the compiler and loader to the pi pico for development and debugging.

Don't forget to change the hard coded GMT+7 Hours to match your timezone.

A practical project for learning and fun!
